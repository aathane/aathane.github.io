        <h3>Digital Product Simulation — Stage</h3>
    </div>

    <h4>Context</h4>
    <p>
        Dassault Systèmes primarily targets large enterprises through direct sales, leaving a significant opportunity in the SME market to its resellers. These SMEs, while smaller individually, represent a substantial collective market with specific needs and investment capacities. Digital Product Simulation (DPS), as a reseller, plays a key role in addressing this segment. The goal of the internship was to enhance lead generation and qualification processes through automation and AI integration, thereby supporting sales growth.

    <h4>Details</h4>
    <p>
        During this internship, my mission was to automate the lead generation process. I started with an audit and a state of the art to determine which tasks could be automated and for which my work could have the most added value. My project was then split into two parts, one automating the lead generation process and the other integrating generative AI to analyze the data and generate a report for the Business Developer team, with an intuitive user interface for non‑developer profiles.

    <h4>Success</h4>
    <p>
        By integrating Python scripts and generative AI, I reduced time per prospect, saving hours of manual work.
